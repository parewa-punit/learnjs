If you want to develop modern websites and web applications (including an internet startup), or if you want a high-paying developer job, JavaScript is undoubtedly the best web-development language to learn today, unless you want to develop native iOS or Android apps exclusively.

What you get
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Learn front-end web development at a super fast pace
* 50+ hours of face time with instructor
* Guest sessions from experienced JavaScript developers
* Two projects by the end of the course
* Learn the basics first, we start with HTML/CSS and quickly move on to JavaScript
* No prior experience with HTML/CSS/JavaScript required
* Certificate of course completion from Parewa Labs
* Internship and Job opportunities at Parewa Labs and other tech companies in Nepal after course completion

Once you are finished with the course, you will slowly build yourself into a rockstar programmer.

I wish you all the best
